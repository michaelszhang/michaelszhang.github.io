  <p>
    I am a senior studying computer science and mathematics at MIT, and I am
    particularly interested in machine learning and quantitative finance. I also
    plan to complete a minor in physics and a concentration in economics. In my
    free time, I enjoy riding my longboard, learning the piano, playing video
    games, and watching anime.

    Currently, I am also completing a master's thesis under professor Phiala Shanahan through
    MIT's MEng program and TA'ing 6.1220/18.410, Design and Analysis of Algorithms.
