    I have been a trader at Jane Street since January 2024. Previously, I received a Master of Engineering (artificial intelligence concentration) and a Bachelor of Science (computer science and math double major + physics minor) from MIT. For my master's thesis, I worked with professor Phiala Shanahan on flow-based sampling algorithms for large-N gauge theories. I was also a TA for 6.1220/18.410, Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

    I've spent most of my efforts in the last year focused on my work at Jane Street. I'd like continue my machine learning and theoretical physics studies from university, but I haven't been able to find the time or mental energy for that lately.

    Outside of work, I enjoy learning piano 🎹, playing video games 🎮, riding my longboard 🛹, and watching football 🏈.
