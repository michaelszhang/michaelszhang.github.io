    I am a Master's student at MIT through the EECS department's MEng program. For my thesis research, I am working in the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI) with professor Phiala Shanahan on flow-based sampling algorithms for large-N gauge theories. I am also a TA for 6.1220/18.410, Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

    Outside of my research, I am also particularly interested in quantitative finance and machine learning. I also enjoy learning piano and dance, playing video games, and riding my longboard in my free time.

    I also received a Bachelor of Science from MIT with a double major in computer science and mathematics and a minor in physics in June 2023.
