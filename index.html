    Hi! I'm Michael, a junior studing computer science and mathematics at MIT,
    and I am particularly interested in the fields of quantitative finance and
    machine learning. I also plan to complete a minor in physics and a
    concentration in econonics. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with
    friends, playing card games, and riding my longboard.
