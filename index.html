  <p>
    I am a junior studying computer science and mathematics at MIT, and am
    particularly interested in quantitative finance and machine learning. I also
    plan to complete a minor in physics and a concentration in economics. In my
    free time, I enjoy riding my longboard, learning to sing, playing video
    games, and watching anime.
