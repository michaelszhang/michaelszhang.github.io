        6.860/9.520 final project: Empirical evaluations of learning datasets
        with weight-sharing and locality.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 1em; margin-top: -1em">
        This project provides an emperical evaluation of the difficulties of
        learning weight-sharing and locality in datasets satisfying both
        assumptions. [<a

        6.867 final project: ClassroomNet: Learning generalizable, interpretable
        features via knowledge distillation.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 1em; margin-top: -1em">
        This project proposes and attempts to implement a neural network
        architecture in which 3D-to-2D knowledge distillation is used to learn
        better features in image processing tasks. [<a

      <p>
        6.854/18.415 final project: Algorithms for fast selection on heap data
        structures.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 1em; margin-top: -1em">
        This project surveys the theory behind the soft heap data structure and
        its uses in selection algorithms. In addition, the selection algorithms
        were implemented and their performances were compared. [<a
